#### Chefs tips

1. Steamed broccoli is a great vegetable to serve with this dish
Wash broccoli in salted water, cut into florets, steam plus mins five minutes until just tender.
Season and toss hot broccoli in olive oil.
2. For a richer version omit 125ml stock and replace with 125ml extra sour cream.
3. Add a little pasta water to tagliatelle, if necessary, if sauce gets absorbed by the pasta.
