# Da Vinci step by step cookery lessons

We thought that with the country being on lockdown and as we can’t make meals for you, it is a perfect opportunity to share some of our favourite dishes and a few of our chef’s secrets from 24 years of Da Vinci. To put on record a handful of this and a pinch of that, which creates the joy of eating homemade/artisanal fresh and flavourful food. During the lockdown (and beyond) we will be providing step by step recipes and instructions to bring a few of Da Vinci’s dishes to your kitchens. 

We plan on using basic and readily available ingredients and providing a simplified version of cooking our meals. Hopefully you have a pot of fresh garden herbs growing to enhance the flavour of our dishes and provide nutrients. 

Let’s go to work!!

## Lesson 1: Homemade Pasta (easy hand cutting)
We will show you the easy to make your own pasta without the need for a maker.
For this version of traditional hand-made pasta we are using all-purpose cake flour which is easily available.

### Ingridients:

		- 200gm all-purpose cake flour
		- 3 x jumbo eggs
		- 3 x pinches salt

### Preparation & Method

1. Sift flour and salt, in shallow bowl, make a well in the middle.

2. Whisk eggs and salt together in small bowl with a fork. Pour into well.

3. Using the same fork, incorporate flour into the egg.

4. Once almost all of the flour is incorporated, start mixing dough with your hands, the dough should be pliable but not sticky, add a little more flour if sticky.

5. Knead dough for plus minus 5 minutes, the dough should be smooth and elastic.
This can be done in a food processor, by placing all ingredients in processor and pulsing for 10 seconds. Knead shortly until smooth.

6. Wrap dough in plastic wrap, rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.

7. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, take one piece out at a time, keeping remaining dough covered.

8. Lightly flour clean work surface, and roll piece of dough in one long piece, roughly 450mm long. Repeat this process with remaining seven pieces.
If using a pasta maker follow, pasta maker instructions for tagliatelle at this stage, otherwise follow hand cutting instructions below.

#### Hand cut pasta (tagliatelle)

1. Fold top third of long piece of pasta down, and bottom third over that like a letter. Turn 90 degrees and roll piece back into a long shape.

2. Roll dough until very thin, you should be able to see through it.

3. Lightly dust the flattened piece of dough and roll it up like a cigar, using little pressure to prevent sticking together. Cut dough with sharp kitchen knife into tagliatelle strips about 5mm wide. Unravel strips immediately to prevent sticking. Sprinkle with extra flour. Dry out on floured work surface or hang on pre-made drying wrack / line for 30 minutes prior to cooking.

#### Cooking your fresh made pasta

1. Bring large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add pasta, stir with pasta spoon to loosen. 2 to 3 minutes for al dente. Fresh pasta will cook quicker than pasta that has been drying out.

2. Remove from water toss in olive oil and serve with your favourite sauce. Reserve a little cooking water to moisten pasta.

#### Chefs tip

Use plenty flour for dusting dough and on work surface
