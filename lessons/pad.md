We thought that with the country being on lockdown and as we can’t make meals for you, it is a perfect opportunity to share some of our favourite dishes and a few of our chef’s secrets from 24 years of Da Vinci.
To put on record a handful of this and a pinch of that, which creates the joy of eating homemade/artisanal fresh and flavourful food. During the lockdown (and beyond) we will be providing step by step recipes and instructions to bring a few of Da Vinci’s dishes to your kitchens.

We plan on using basic and readily available ingredients and providing a simplified version of cooking our meals. Hopefully you have a pot of fresh garden herbs growing to enhance the flavour of our dishes and provide nutrients. 

## First public post
Welcome to Da Vinci Artisanal Cookery Lessons

Steve and I would like to share our love of cooking with you, by offering a special collection of recipes to recreate at home. These recipes are a mix of classic and traditional dishes, mixed with with our own creative Da Vinci twist.

Steve, a lifelong restauranteur who grew up in a Mediterranean home, always in the kitchen with Mama, Papa and the family, will be sharing some of those family secrets that have been handed down over generations.
From my classical chefs training at Silwood Kitchen and 30 years of experience, I will be sharing my favourite comfort food recipes and culinary masterpieces.

We hope you enjoy our recipes and lessons and look forward to receiving your feed back.

Enjoy,
Chef Leah Baleta
