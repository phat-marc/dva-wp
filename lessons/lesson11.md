Half a broccoli, washed and cut into florets
15ml extra virgin olive oil
1 x quarter cauliflower, washed and cut into florets
Half a red/green pepper, roasted and skinned(optional)
Half a butternut, peeled and thickly sliced (plus minus 1cm thick)

125gm, firm button mushrooms, wiped and thinly sliced
Half a ripe avocado (optional)

12 x mini Italian rosa tomatoes , washed
12 x calamata olives
50gm good quality mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced
100gm feta cheese, cubed
Fresh basil
Fresh Rocket
Balsamic reduction (optional)

### Method
1. Bring water to the boil in large stainless-steel saucepan. Add two teaspoons salt.
2. Cook vegetables briefly in boiling water separately, until just tender, drain and cool under cold running water to halt the cooking process. (Blanching the vegetables helps retain their colour).
3. Assemble shortly before serving, according to method below. 

Approximate cooking times
Baby marrows - 1 minute
Green beans - 2 minutes
Broccoli - 2 minutes, drained and tossed in olive oil, while still slightly warm
Cauliflower - 3 minutes
Butternut - 10 minutes
Vegetables should be still slightly crunchy. Vegetables can be cooked a few hours before serving.

{Use photo as example to assemble.}

### Assembly Method
Using a deep white serving platter or white plate with a lip is best. The white background will make the different colours stand out.

1. Place 350ml of Da Vinci vinaigrette in mixing bowl, add crushed garlic.
2. Using slotted spoon toss cooked vegetables individually in vinaigrette mixture, transfer to platter,
arrange creatively.
3. Add mushrooms to bowl, mix and coat in the remaining vinaigrette, place on platter/ plate in
middle of the vegetables.
4. Thinly slice avocado, sprinkle with lemon juice, arrange on platter.
5. Lastly arrange lettuce, tomatoes, rosa tomatoes , cheese, onion rings, olives and herbs on platter.
6. Top with any remaining vinaigrette.
7. Drizzle balsamic reduction around edge

Serve with rustic bread or focaccia.

### Chefs Tip
1. Cook vegetables before the time and keep cool.
2. Assemble just before serving for best results.
3. Artichoke hearts and fresh blanched asparagus can be a good optional extra.
4. Do not allow the vegetables to marinate too long in the vinaigrette as they will lose colour.
