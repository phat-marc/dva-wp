## Lesson 5: Pavlova - Da Vinci style (Makes 8 individual pavlovas)

Pavlova is a dream of a dessert, a wonderful combination of flavour and textures.
It was made for the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlovas in the 1920’s, hence the name of this chewy fruit filled meringue.

## Ingredients

4 extra large egg whites @ room temperature
250gm castor sugar
10ml vanilla essence
5ml spirt vinegar
Pinch of salt
15ml cornflour
250ml fresh cream, whipped
250gm fresh strawberries, washed, hulled and sliced
100ml granadilla pulp (optional)
Sprigs of mint to decorate (optional)

### Preparation & Method

1. Pre-heat oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

2. Line baking tray with parchment paper.

3. Beat egg whites in clean dry bowl of electric mixer until stiff. Gradually add large spoonful’s
of castor sugar beating well after each addition. With the last spoonful of castor sugar add
the vanilla essence, vinegar, salt and cornflour. Beat a few minutes more until mixture
forms stiff peaks and is glossy.

4. Using a large metal spoon and a spatula, spoon meringue on to baking tray dividing into
approximately eight circles. Make a well in each using a dessert spoon with high sides
around the edge of each circle.

5. Bake for 10 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius, then turn heat down to 120 degrees Celsius for a
further hour.

6. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.

7. Just before serving top with whipped cream, allowing cream to flow over the sides. Top with
strawberries and granadilla pulp. Decorate with a sprig of mint.

#### Chefs tips

1. Any other fruit may be used e.g. Frozen berries, fruit salads or kiwi fruit.
2. Ice cream can be used instead of the traditional fresh cream.
3. It is important that the mixing bowl and beater are completely dry before beating egg
whites.
4. Eggs used at room temperature give a greater volume.
5. Add castor sugar gradually, beating continuously after each addition.
6. Pavlova can be made in advance and can be stored in airtight cake tins for one to two weeks.
