Grease a 24 cm or 25 cm spring form round cake pan  
1. Cream butter and sugar in bowl of electric cake mixture until light in colour, add vanilla essence

Topping
Place ingredients in heavy based saucepan/frying pan
Stir over low heat until sugar has melted
Increase heat slowly, stirring continuously until thickened and caramel in colour
Pour over hot cake
Allow to cool for half an hour before loosening the side of the spring form pan
Serve with whipped cream or ice-cream

### Chefs tip
When baking in a loose bottom spring form cake pan, always place on oven tray to prevent
spillage in your oven
2 Be careful not to burn the topping as it turns to caramel, I use a heavy based wide stainless
steel frying pan, as it quickens the caramel cooking process
